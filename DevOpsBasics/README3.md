## Introduction to CI, CD and CD

### What is SDLC
Software Development Life Cycle
- Plan
- Build
- Test
- Deploy

### Disadvantages of SDLC
- Scale and complexity
    -  Functions
    - Archietcture
    - Infrastructure
    - Developers
    - Operations
- Manual and slow process
- Broken communication
- Human errors
- Large volume of testing
- Long deployment windows
- High cost


### DevOps in SDLC
- DevOps came to help modern SDLC - Agile
    - Collaboration, Automation

### DevOps LifeCycle stages
- Continuous Development
- Continuous Testing
- Continuous Integration
    - Merging all dev's working copies to a shared mainline several times a day
    - Automation (Development-Commit-Version Control - Build - Test)
- Continuous Delivery/Deployment
    - Continuous delivery = producing software in short cycle which is manual
    - Continuous deployment = producing software frequently through automation
    - Code done - Unit tests - Integrate tests - acceptance test - (auto/manual) - Deploy
    - Pipeline phases = Commit, Build, Automate tests and Deploy
- Continuous Monitoring

### Why CI/CD Matters
- Reduce Cost
- Faster release rate
- Smaller code changes
- Fault isolations
- More test reliability
- Increase team transparency and accountability
- Easy maintenance and updates

### Conclusion: DevOps Helps
- CAMS
- Automation tools
- SDLC
- System Quality
- Business Value
- Cost efficiency
